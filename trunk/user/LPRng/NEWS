---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version LPRng-3.8.A
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release not done by Patrick Powell but
by the new team to maintain LPRng. The project is hosted
on sourceforge, take a look at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lprng/
and join us on the new mailing-list at
http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/lprng-devel

The biggest change is the switch to using automake to generate
the Makefile.im and cleaning the autoconf rules a bit. Most
things should work just as before, with the following exceptions:

- make install no longer tries to remove previous installed
  printing systems and to modify your system to run LPRng, you
  will have to do this yourself. Example files with descriptions
  can be found in the conf/ subdirectory of the source.
- binaries are currently not made suid even if requested,
  that might be reimplemented in the future.
- when configuring with --enable-nls less time is invested in
  finding a gettext implementation. You might need to give it
  some more flags when using a gettext not in your libc.

There is a new configure option --disable-remote to change the default
to not listen via tcp and not accepting requests from remote hosts.
(Also without --disable-remote, lpd_listen_port defaults to 515 and
not lpd_port).

Otherwise a lot of cleanup has happened. Many compiler warnings
quieted, prototypes added, format strings synced with format
of arguments, some code and manpages with strange license situation
replaced, ip mask parsing more robus, local functions declared static,
deleting some unreachable code, moving some code around to not have to
link all lpd code in all other binaries...
