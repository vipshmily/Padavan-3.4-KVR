  SUPER EXPRESS INSTALLATION FOR TERMINALLY IMPATIENT SYSADMINS

READ THE NEXT COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS:

To put files and executables in the most common 'STANDARD locations' 

   sh STANDARD_configuration
   make clean; make all; make install;
   <install conf files (or just copy the .sample files)>
   checkpc -f
   <setup init script or other way to start lpd>

The "STANDARD_configuration" script will run configure and set the most common
configuration for UNIX/LINUX systems:

  - /etc/printcap, /etc/lpd/lpd.conf, /etc/lpd/lpd.perms configuration files.
  - executables in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/libexec/filters
  - you do not need any include files from /usr/local/include
    or libraries from /usr/local/lib
  - no Kerberos support

   Here is the contents of the STANDARD_configuration file:
    #!/bin/sh
	set -x
	if [ -d /usr/share/man ] ; then
		mandir="--mandir=/usr/share/man"
	fi
	sh ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc $mandir \
	 --disable-kerberos --enable-ssl --enable-force_localhost \

  You can simply do:
     sh STANDARD_configuration
     make clean all
     (as root):
       make install
       <install conf files (or just copy the .sample files)>
       checkpc -f
       <setup init script or other way to start lpd>


USING CONFIGURE DEFAULTS DIRECTORIES
 
  By default, configure will put files in /usr/local/... directories.
  If you want to install LPRng in parallel with your existing printing system,
  you can have configure put the executables in the /usr/local/... locations:
     configure;
     make clean all
     (as root):
       <install conf files>
       make install
       checkpc -f
       <setup init script or other way to start lpd>

   The currently running LPD server must be shut down and the LPRng lpd
   server started.

CAVEATS and WARNINGS:

    The LPRng software requires an ANSI C compiler and a make utility that is
    compatible with Gnu Make (verson 3.73 or later) or FreeBSD 4.2 or later.
    LPRng is compiled and tested using GCC and Gnu Make.

INCLUDE FILES AND LIBRARIES

If you are using GETOPT or Kerberos you may need to extend the search
paths for include files and libraries.  See the STANDARD_configuration
and KERBEROS_configuration files for examples.

Solaris Users:

   You can get precompiled versions of the GCC compiler and GNU Make
   from:
      www.sunfreeware.com

   The LPRng code has NOT been tested with the Sun Microsystems compilers,
   and NOT been tested with 64 bit support enabled.

   During compilation and installation, the PATH environment variable
   MUST have /usr/local/bin FIRST followed by /usr/ccs/bin:

     PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:$PATH

   If you have ANY problems with compilation,  and you are NOT using a
   'clean' GCC installation,  please install GCC from a package (see
   http://www.sunfreeware.com) or remove gcc and reinstall it.
   Make sure that the include files are correct for your version
   of Solaris.  In fact, I recommend that you do the compilation on a
   'clean' machine that has nothing but a 'virgin' Solaris Install +
   utilities BEFORE reporting problems.

     You have been warned.

HPUX Users:

    See the following site for precompiled GCC and other tools:
         http://hpux.cae.wisc.edu/

   I STRONGLY recommend installing GCC and using GCC.  Make sure
   that your include files are the correct ones for your particular
   OS.

   If you use the native or HP provided C compiler,  you will need to
   add some additional flags to allow ANSI C compatibility.  The
   -Aa and -Ae are candidates,  but you will have to check your
   particular compiler for details.

   Ryan Novosielski <novosirj@umdnj.edu> suggests that
   for HP-UX 11.0 and 11.11 you may need to use
   --with-linker=/usr/bin/ld

     You have been warned.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WARNING FOR THE SANITY OF SYSADMINS

    It is extremely dangerous to use NFS mounted file systems for spool
    directories.  The LPRng system depends on file locking for process
    coordination and synchronization.  Given the historical evidence
    of problems with file locks and NFS,  not to mention the terrible
    performance impact,  it is strongly recommended that you use a
    local file system for your spool directories.

     You have been warned.

SYSTEM STARTUP SCRIPTS

There is a couple of system startup scripts in the conf/ directory
of the LPRng source. (most with some instructions how to set them
up, though those might be a bit out of date).

CONFIGURATION

  The configure (autoconf) utility is used to specify the
  location of files and run time options for the LPRng software.

  configure (autoconf) defaults for files and directories:
     ${prefix}  - default is /usr/local
     ${exec_prefix}  - default is ${prefix}
     ${bindir}  is usually ${exec_refix}/bin, (/usr/local/bin)
     ${sbindir} is usually ${exec_prefix}/sbin (/usr/local/sbin)
     ${libdir} is usually ${exec_prefix}/lib (/usr/local/lib)
     ${libexecdir} is usually ${exec_prefix}/libexec (/usr/local/libexec)
     ${sysconfdir} is usually ${prefix}/etc (/usr/local/etc)
     ${mandir} is usually ${prefix}/man     (/usr/local/man)

  CONFIGURATION FILES:

     THIS PARAGAPH DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE CURRENT BEHAVIOUR

     All of the LPRng configuration files but printcap files go in
     ${sysconfdir}/lpd/, usually /etc/lpd/.  The printcap file,
     for historical and backwards compatibility reasons,
     is is in ${sysconfdir}/printcap, i.e. - /etc/printcap.
     We install a sample lpd.conf, lpd.perms, and printcap files,
     sufficed with SAMPLESUFFIX, which is .sample by default:

     Default 'configure' locations (and installed example files):
         lpd.conf:   /usr/local/etc/lpd/lpd.conf  (/usr/local/etc/lpd/lpd.conf.sample)
         lpd.perms:  /usr/local/etc/lpd/lpd.perms (/usr/local/etc/lpd/lpd.perms.sample)
         printcap:   /usr/local/etc/printcap (/usr/local/etc/printcap.sample)

     Standard UNIX Configuration (and installed example files):
         lpd.conf:   /etc/lpd/lpd.conf  (/etc/lpd/lpd.conf.sample)
         lpd.perms:  /etc/lpd/lpd.perms (/etc/lpd/lpd.perms.sample)
         printcap:   /etc/printcap (/etc/printcap.sample)

  EXECUTABLES AND MAN PAGES:
         (* indicates SETUID root permissions, not set by current makefiles)
     ${bindir}/ lpr*, lprm*, lpq*, lpstat*
     ${sbindir}/lpc*, checkpc, lpd
     ${libexecdir}/filters/ lpf, banner, etc
     ${mandir}/ man pages

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

  In addition to the --prefix, etc., mentioned above,  there are several
    more you can use:

     COMPILATION:
  Environment variables (also can be on command line):
  CC=          C compiler command
  CFLAGS=      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS=     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  CPPFLAGS=    C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
              headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP=         C preprocessor

STARTING LPD SERVER AND CHECKING CONFIGURATION

    Use the following command to check to see that
    the LPD server is running on the localhost:

       #> lpc -s localhost lpd

    If it has not been started,  then you can start it by hand:

       #> /usr/sbin/lpd

INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If the installation step did not install the executables
in the correct location or there are other problems,
use the following procedures to fix up the install:

    # kill off the old server
    On BSD:
    kill `ps -aux |grep lpd | awk '{print $2}'`
    On System V:
    kill `ps -e |grep lpd | awk '{print $1}'`

You should remove or rename the original lpd binaries if they
have are still present:

    mv /usr/lib/lpd /usr/lib/lpd.old
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/lpd /usr/lib/lpd
    # you might want to track down the old lpr, lpq, lprm binaries
    find /usr -type file -name lp\*  -print >/tmp/candidates
    find /sbin -type file -name lp\* -print >>/tmp/candidates
    # Examine the /tmp/candidates file, and remove or rename the
    # non-LPRng versions of the programs
    # remove or rename the candidate files
    /usr/local/sbin/lpd;    # start up LPD
      OR
    /usr/sbin/lpd;    # start up LPD
      OR
    /????/lpd         # start up LPD
    lpq;    # test it with LPQ

If you are running on Solaris, see the Solaris section in the LPRng
Reference Manual for further instructions on integration with the
LP subsystem.

PRINTCAP FILES:

Read the comments in the /etc/printcap.sample for details on
how to set up a simple set of printcap entries.  You may also
want to read the Printing Cookbook and the LPRng Reference Manual
documentation.

SECURITY WARNINGS:

  The default configuration for LPRng allows connections from
  any port while a strict RFC1179 implementation would require
  connections only from a port in the range 721-731.  Relaxing
  this restriction allows non-setuid root clients (lpr, lpq, etc)
  to connect to the LPRng server.

  The following is the default LPRng system installation:

    1. All client programs are installed Setuid Root.
       (NOT in the current version, yet undecided if that will come back)
    2. No checking is done for strict RFC1179 conformance by
       the lpd server
    3. By default, all client programs will connect to the server
       on the local host (force_localhost configuration option).

  This configuration allows you to connect directly to non-LPRng systems
  using the LPRng clients,  and to have the maximum flexibility with the
  least amount of system configuration problems.  You can modify the
  /etc/printcap file, and set 'force_localhost@' to send jobs to
  a remote print server which requires connections
  to originate from a privileged port.

  The described configuration has the drawback of having SETUID clients,
  which is regarded as dangerous .

  A more cautious approch is to use the following:

    1. No LPRng programs are installed Setuid Root
       (configure --disable-setuid)
    2. All clients communicate directly to the server on the localhost.
       (i.e. - force_localhost is used)
    3. The server is started at system initialization time by root
       and it is the only program that opens a connection to a
       remote print spooler.  This now reduces the problem
       to a much more manageable level.

  If you are truly paranoid then you should read the LPRng Refernece
  Manual and the Printing Cookbook sections on Authentication,  and
  add either SSL or Kerberos authentication to your system.

KERBEROS:

  LPRng uses the MIT Kerberos 5 distribution and provides backwards
  compatibility with the MIT Kerberos 4 print support system.

  If you want to use Kerberos authentication then configure with
  the following options:

  - for Kerberos 5 only:
  ./configure --enable-kerberos

  You may need to add the following if your libraries and include files are
  not in the 'usual' places.  Replace /usr/local/lib with the directory
  where the Kerberos libraries are and /usr/local/include where the include
  files are.

    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" \
     CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"

******************** OVERRIDING CONFIGURES' GUESSES ******************
If you get errors similar to the ones below, it may be
because "configure" guessed wrong. You can override the
guesses here, by editing the file config.h configure
generates or by adding the given options to your CFLAGS,
e.g ./configure CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -g -W -DMAKE_USE_STATFS=STATVFS -DMAKE_USE_STTY=TERMIOS"

"recvfiles.c: unknown struct fsb has no size":
define STATFS: to use statfs(2) (BSD)
       STATVFS: to use statvfs(2) (SVR4)
    others for system specific cases

either modify USE_STATFS_TYPE in config.h or add one of:

-DMAKE_USE_STATFS=ULTRIX_STATFS
-DMAKE_USE_STATFS=SVR3_STATFS
-DMAKE_USE_STATFS=STATVFS
-DMAKE_USE_STATFS=STATFS

define MAKE_USE_STTY = 
   SGTTYB   to use struct sgttyb and <sgtty.h> (BSD)
   TERMIO  to use struct termio and <termio.h> (old sysV)
   TERMIOS to use struct termios and <termio.h> (SVR4)

either modify USE_STTY in config.h or add one of:

 -DMAKE_USE_STTY=SGTTYB
 -DMAKE_USE_STTY=TERMIO
 -DMAKE_USE_STTY=TERMIOS

a better way to do this is to edit the "ARGH" section of portable.h,
and add the appropriate lines to the section for your OS, or add a new
section if one doesn't exist; then you can send me the patches and
I'll incorporate them into the distribution.

SETPROCTITLE - overwrites the program argument information
  when ps is used, displays status.  Used only by LPD
if this does not work, add the following:

-DNO_SETPROCTITLE

## ****** TESTING AND SECURITY LOOPHOLE ******************************
Define GETENV to allow the LPD_CONF environment
 variable to be used as the name of a configuration file.  In non-testing
 systems,  this is a security loophole.
add -DGETENV=\"1\"
